# DASH (9-11 October 2023, Laurel, MD)

[Public notes]

## Day 1

### Opening Plenary Talks

#### Navigating through the maze of heliophysics data -- Laura Hayes

- need centralized, easily navigable directory/portal for all heliophysics data
  (or repos able to communicate between themselves)
- need modern workflows: compute near archive

#### Alisdair Davey

- they don't run Perl scripts on data providers's server anymore?
- SOLARNET FITS keywords?

#### Open science challenges in heliophysics -- Baptiste Cecconi

- FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable)
- findable: VSO, HDP, VESPA, AMDA
- ML for heliophysics: event detection

### Cloud computing in heliophysics

#### William Fawcett

- SDO Scientific Computing Platform

#### Christopher Jeschke

- HelioCloud
- Daskhub - Jupyterhub

#### Jennifer Knuth (for Chris Pankratz)

- SWx TREC
- [H3lioVis]
- [LiveDst]

#### Michael Wiltberger

- Center for Geospace Storms (NASA Drive Center)
- MAGE model

#### Matthew Lesko

- CCMC

#### Umar Salman

- Kubernetes

#### Bryan Harter

- "Science Data System": data management, data processing, data analysis, and
  data dissemination


### Modern Data Pipeline Strategies

#### Alysa Derks

- DKIST takes about 8 TB/day right now
- AirFlow schedules tasks
- Globus

#### Chris Lowder

- Punch
- Prefect (like AirFlow)
- Python pipeline

#### Gabriel Dima

- CCOR

#### Mike Shumko

- asilib
- three main classes: Imager, Imagers (mosiacs), Conjunction (combine with
  other data)

#### Brad Trantham

- "Building Next Generation Ground Data Software"
- avoid tight coupling between input, processing, and output (have an IO layer
  that converts from physical representation to logical representation)
- generic tools that use metadata in FITS, etc. files

#### Discussion

- Can you stop/start the pipeline at a given point? DKIST: No
- How portable do you need to make the pipeline because of the long life of an
  instrument? DKIST: scientists have to write a pipeline, and it takes "us"
  about a year to incorporate
- It is good to have scientists and computer scientists talk more.
- LASP will have a pipeline conference sometime next year.

### Data Access Interfaces and Services

#### Mark Parsons

#### Alex Chartier

- FAIR access to heliophysics data: SuperDARN
- Zenodo

#### Carrie Gonzalez

- HAPI

#### Christian Steigies

- "NMDB data access capabilities and challenges"

#### Ryan McGranaghan

- HelioWeb

#### Discussion

- version data?

## Day 2

- DONKI CCMC event database

## Day 3

Parallel tracks

### Moving to all open-source in Heliophysics

### Advancing Data Portals for Open Heliophysics Research

### Methods and Software Tools for Forward Synthesis and Inverting Plasma and Magnetic Information in the Solar Corona

Alin's session

### Sessions Summary


## My summary for MLSO

- SOLARNET FITS standards are built on top of the FITS standards. These specify
  how exactly to use the keywords in practice. DKIST and others are using these
  standards.
- We should make sure our data satisfies all the FAIR principles.
- A lot of people from models on CCMC were there.
- NCAR new data portal will meet a lot of features discussed by data providers:
  Globus, OpenDAP, Jupyter notebooks with access to data.
- Lots of discussion of HAPI, but I don't think it is suitable for our needs.
  It is specifically for time series and I don't think it will work for images.
- Should we put the version of the data in the filename? Or maybe just the
  tarball filenames for level 1 and 2 data?
- We should get MLSO and/or instrument stickers.
- Mentioned potential job openings to a couple people, but should have URL or
  something to give people.
- Ended up picking a breakout ("unconference") session with a bunch of SPASE
  people.
- Presented a slide on UCoMP data in Alin's session.
